    "# Classification using Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, with supervised learning algorithms, the learner receives labels for a set of instances. In the case of MIL, the learner receives labels for a set of bags, each of which contains a set of instances. The bag is labeled positive if it contains at least one positive instance, and negative if it does not contain any.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often assumed in image classification tasks that each image clearly represents a class label. In medical imaging (e.g. computational pathology, etc.) an entire image is represented by a single class label (cancerous/non-cancerous) or a region of interest could be given. However, one will be interested in knowing which patterns in the image is actually causing it to belong to that class. In this context, the image(s) will be divided and the subimages will form the bag of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the goals are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Learn a model to predict a class label for a bag of instances.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Find out which instances within the bag caused a position class label prediction.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps describe how the model works:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>The feature extractor layers extract feature embeddings.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The embeddings are fed into the MIL attention layer to get the attention scores. The layer is designed as permutation-invariant.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Input features and their corresponding attention scores are multiplied together.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The resulting output is passed to a softmax function for classification.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
