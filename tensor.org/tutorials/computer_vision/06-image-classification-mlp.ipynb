    "This example implements three modern attention-free, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based models for image classification, demonstrated on the CIFAR-100 dataset:\n",

    "The purpose of the example is not to compare between these models, as they might perform differently on different datasets with well-tuned hyperparameters. Rather, it is to show simple implementations of their main building blocks.\n",
