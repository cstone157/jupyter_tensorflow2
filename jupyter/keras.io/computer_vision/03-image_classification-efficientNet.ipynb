    "### Introduction: what is EfficientNet\n",
    "\n",
    "EfficientNet, first introduced in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946\">Tan and Le, 2019</a> is among the most efficient models (i.e. requiring least FLOPS for inference) that reaches State-of-the-Art accuracy on both imagenet and common image classification transfer learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest base model is similar to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11626\">MnasNet</a>, which reached near-SOTA with a significantly smaller model. By introducing a heuristic way to scale the model, EfficientNet provides a family of models (B0 to B7) that represents a good combination of efficiency and accuracy on a variety of scales. Such a scaling heuristics (compound-scaling, details see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946\">Tan and Le, 2019</a>) allows the efficiency-oriented base model (B0) to surpass models at every scale, while avoiding extensive grid-search of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A summary of the latest updates on the model is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet\">here</a>, where various augmentation schemes and semi-supervised learning approaches are applied to further improve the imagenet performance of the models. These extensions of the model can be used by updating weights without changing model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### B0 to B7 variants of EfficientNet\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>(This section provides some details on \"compound scaling\", and can be skipped if you're only interested in using the models)</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946\">original paper</a> people may have the impression that EfficientNet is a continuous family of models created by arbitrarily choosing scaling factor in as Eq.(3) of the paper. However, choice of resolution, depth and width are also restricted by many factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Resolution: Resolutions not divisible by 8, 16, etc. cause zero-padding near boundaries of some layers which wastes computational resources. This especially applies to smaller variants of the model, hence the input resolution for B0 and B1 are chosen as 224 and 240.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Depth and width: The building blocks of EfficientNet demands channel size to be multiples of 8.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Resource limit: Memory limitation may bottleneck resolution when depth and width can still increase. In such a situation, increasing depth and/or width but keep resolution can still improve performance.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the depth, width and resolution of each variant of the EfficientNet models are hand-picked and proven to produce good results, though they may be significantly off from the compound scaling formula. Therefore, the keras implementation (detailed below) only provide these 8 models, B0 to B7, instead of allowing arbitray choice of width / depth / resolution parameters.\n",

    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keras implementation of EfficientNet\n",

    "\n",
    "On unfreezing layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The BatchNormalization layers need to be kept frozen (more details). If they are also turned to trainable, the first epoch after unfreezing will significantly reduce accuracy.</li>\n",
    "    <li>In some cases it may be beneficial to open up only a portion of layers instead of unfreezing all. This will make fine tuning much faster when going to larger models like B7.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Each block needs to be all turned on or off. This is because the architecture includes a shortcut from the first layer to the last layer for each block. Not respecting blocks also significantly harms the final performance.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other tips for utilizing EfficientNet:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Larger variants of EfficientNet do not guarantee improved performance, especially for tasks with less data or fewer classes. In such a case, the larger variant of EfficientNet chosen, the harder it is to tune hyperparameters.</li>\n",
    "    <li>EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is very helpful in training EfficientNet from scratch, but not so much for transfer learning.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Do not use the RMSprop setup as in the original paper for transfer learning. The momentum and learning rate are too high for transfer learning. It will easily corrupt the pretrained weight and blow up the loss. A quick check is to see if loss (as categorical cross entropy) is getting significantly larger than log(NUM_CLASSES) after the same epoch. If so, the initial learning rate/momentum is too high.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Smaller batch size benefit validation accuracy, possibly due to effectively providing regularization.</li>\n",
