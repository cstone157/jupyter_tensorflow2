Saving also means you can share your model and others can recreate your work. When publishing research models and techniques, most machine learning practitioners share:\n",

    "There are different ways to save TensorFlow models depending on the API you're using. This guide uses <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras\">tf.keras</a>â€”a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow. The new, high-level .keras format used in this tutorial is recommended for saving Keras objects, as it provides robust, efficient name-based saving that is often easier to debug than low-level or legacy formats. For more advanced saving or serialization workflows, especially those involving custom objects, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize\">Save and load Keras models guide</a>. For other approaches, refer to the <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model\">Using the SavedModel format guide</a>.\n",
